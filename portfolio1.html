            <ul>
                <li><span>Computer Science</span> is often seen as a technology-focused field rooted in mathematics and engineering principles. A key example of this is the study of algorithms, which are fundamental to programming and hardware design.</li>
                <li>However, the scope of Computer Science extends beyond programming. It includes areas such as system architecture, operating system design, database structuring, and model validation, all of which are distinct from programming itself.</li>
                <li>At its core, Computer Science emphasizes analysis and abstraction, maintaining a strong connection to theoretical concepts.</li>
                <li>The field extends beyond programming to include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>System architecture</li>
                        <li>Operating system design</li>
                        <li>Database structuring</li>
                        <li>Model validation</li>

            <h1>Computing Disciplines and Majors</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Computer Science</span> can be seen as the study of algorithmsâ€”precisely defined rules that guide the process of producing specific outputs from given inputs in a limited number of steps. While the foundations of Computer Science date back to ancient times, it is through computers that we can fully realize its potential. Without computers, we lack the precision and speed required to execute complex procedures, making the true potential of algorithmic studies achievable until the advent of general-purpose computing machines.</li>
                <li><span>Computer Engineering</span> started as a specialization in Electrical Engineering before becoming its own field. It applied Computer Science logic to develop microprocessors and systems for various uses. While incorporating Computer Science principles, it kept its focus on hardware and design. These advancements help make the world more efficient, safer, and smarter.</li>
                <li><span>Information Systems</span> explore the development, use, and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations. Originating in the 1960s with the standardization of data processing applications, it has since expanded to study how organizations adapt to evolving technologies. Over time, research in this area has made organizational knowledge more accessible.</li>
                <li><span>Information Technology</span> involves the processes and methods used to manage and transfer information through computers and telecommunications tools. It covers activities such as collecting, organizing, storing, and using various forms of information, including texts, images, and numbers. The advancements in Information Technology have transformed education by enabling students to access information beyond the classroom, increasing their motivation to learn through diverse sources.</li>
                <li><span>Software Engineering</span> focuses on developing, maintaining, and improving computer programs. With the digital shift, software engineers can work in various industries like finance, manufacturing, and software publishing. The discipline requires strong coding skills, analytical abilities, and creativity. Collaboration is essential in designing, building, testing, and documenting applications, as well as gathering user feedback for improvements. While software engineers focus on system design, they also often write original code alongside developers.</li>
