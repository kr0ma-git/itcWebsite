        <span><h1>Comparative Study on Different Types of Motherboards</h1></span>

            <h3 style="font-size: 2.2vw; text-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3); padding: 1.2vw 0 .5vw">Introduction/Background</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>The Planar Breadboard</span>, created by <span>IBM engineer Patty McHugh</span>, was the first backplane identified as a motherboard. Released in the 1981 IBM Personal Computer, it included a 4.77 MHz microprocessor, 16 KB of memory, 8-bit ISA connectors, and ports for a keyboard and cassette tape for data storage. Additional components like display adapters and hard disk controllers were connected via expansion cards inserted into the motherboard’s slots, similar to a backplane configuration.</li>
                <li>In 1984, IBM introduced the <span>advanced-technology (AT) motherboard</span>, commonly known as the <span> “full AT.”</span> Measuring around 30 cm by 33 cm (12 inches by 13 inches), it became the standard for desktops and tower cases. However, its large size made it difficult to upgrade systems or fit into the increasingly popular slimline desktop cases. In 1989, the Baby AT (BAT) motherboard was introduced to address these challenges, offering a more compact size of 21.6 cm by 33 cm (8.5 inches by 13 inches).</li>
                <li style="font-size: 1.7vw"><span>The Motherboard</span>
                    <ul>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.2vw; padding: 1.5vw 1.5vw 1.5vw">The motherboard is the largest circuit board in a computer, connecting the CPU, RAM, and other components while providing power. Different types are designed for specific models, and since processors and memory are optimized for certain motherboards, it's rare to find one that fits all. However, hard drives are generally compatible with various motherboard brands and models. Since different processors and memory types are tailored for specific motherboards, it's uncommon to find one that is compatible with all CPUs and memory types. However, hard drives are more adaptable and typically work with a broad range of motherboard brands and models. The motherboard, situated within the computer casing, acts as the central connection point for the computer’s components and peripherals. In tower computers, it is usually placed on the right or left side of the case and is the primary circuit board.</p>

            <h1>Types of Motherboards</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The <span>AT Motherboard</span> is large and not ideal for mini desktops, with poorly labeled six-pin power connectors that make installation difficult.</li>
                <li>In the 1990s, Intel introduced the smaller <span>ATX Motherboard</span>, which improved connector organization and made it easier to swap components.</li>
                <li><span>LPX motherboards</span> included rear Input/Output ports and Riser Cards for extra slots but lacked AGP slots, which hindered performance—a limitation later resolved by NLX models.</li>
                <li><span>BTX motherboards</span>, built for high-power usage, were discontinued in the mid-2000s as Intel shifted its focus to low-power CPUs.</li>
                <li>The compact <span>Pico BTX</span> variant, which supports two expansion slots, is well-suited for digital applications.</li>
                <li>The <span>Mini ITX Motherboard</span> , measuring 17 x 17 cm, is ideal for small form factor (SFF) computers because of its low power consumption and efficient cooling, making it a popular option for home theater systems.</li>
